        //and current GPA (1-4). Store a list of 10 or more fake students in a list. 
        //Then, use LINQ to print a list of students with a GPA of 3 or higher that are in the 9th - 12th grade. 
        //The list should output their first name, last name, grade and GPA. 
        //It should be sorted by highest grade level, then highest GPA, then last name, then first name.

        /*1. The Student class should have a static method called "StarStudents" which takes a Student list 
         * and returns a Student list that
         * - contains only the students in grades 9-12
         * - is sorted by highest grade, then highest GPA, then last name, then first name. (edited)
         * 2. The Student class GPA property should have a min value of 0 and max value of 4. 
         * If a user of the class tries to set the value of the GPA below/above the min/max, 
         * it will be set at the min/max instead.
         * 3. The Student Grade has a min of 1 and a max of 12. If a user of the class tries to set 
         * the value of the Grade below/above the min/max, it will be set at the min/max instead.
         * The rest of the instructions about printing etc. aren't tested and therefore aren't 
         * part of the requirements. Its probably a good idea to do so for testing purposes.
